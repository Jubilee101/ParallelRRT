    <h2> Summary </h2>
    <p>We propose to implement a parallel version of RRT algorithm, compare its performance against the serial version
        and benchmark it on different number of cores.</p>
    <h2> Background </h2>
    <p>RRT is Rapidly Exploring Random Trees algorithm typically used in motion planning in autonomous vehicles
        therefore it's quite important to speed up the computation time to reduce the decision time of autonomous
        vehicle. RRT-based algorithms are relatively easy to implement without establishing a detailed map and also they
        are efficient for high dimensional state space.</p>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>1. Difficult to parallelize outer iterative loop because each iteration has strong data dependency with the
        previous iteration because they need to update the kd-tree, insert the node.</p>
    <p>2. Hard to parallelize both finding nearby nodes and collision detection at the same time due to the nature of
        the
        algorithm.
    </p>
    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p>We will start by a serial implementation of RRT and we will use the OpenMP to accelerate the RRT and analyze the
        speedup of the algorithm. And also we found some implementations using Cuda or OpenMP without optimal data
        structure, we would like to evaluate their performance and compare our performance with theirs.
    </p>
    <h2>Goals and Deliverables
    </h2>
    <h3>Basic Goal
    </h3>

    <p>Our basic goal is to have a working version of the RRT algorithm, as well as the benchmark script to measure the
        performance, then implement a basic parallel version RRT and compare the performance differences.
    </p>
    <h3>Ideal Goal</h3>
    <p>
        Our ideal goal is to improve our parallel version RRT with better parallel strategy as well as using data
        structures such as k-d tree and compare the performance difference with version 1 and speedup with different
        number of cores.
    </p>
    <h3>Extra Goal</h3>
    <p>
        If things go well and we still have time, we will try to mitigate our algorithm on GPU using cuda and measure
        performance difference. We will also try to make our k-d tree lock free and achieve even better parallelism.
    </p>

    <h2>Platform Choice:
    </h2>
    <p>We will use the multi-core CPU (the GHC machines) for our basic implementation. And we will try to benchmark it
        on the PSC machine as well. Then if we have time, we will try to mitigate it on the GPU.
